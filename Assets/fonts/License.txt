(Abbreviated) rules of use

With a license you can:
-Install the font on five devices, not necessarily at the same physical location.
-Embed the font into files for preview and printing (as a PDF, for instance).
-Send a copy to the service bureau so they can reproduce a job for you (this copy must be deleted when the process is done).
-Open and modify the font in a software such as FontLab, so it can best fit your purposes, as long as the author has been previously informed.

But you cannot:
-Install the font on more than five devices if you have not purchased additional licenses.
-Embed the font into files or applications who allow the editing of the document, or to extract or install the font.
-Allow the service bureau to keep the font after they process the job (although you can invite them to get their own license).
-Redistribute the font to non-authorized persons, either the original or the font modified by you.

The detailed rules of use are reproduced below. I will not lie: it is a boring text. But it is important to know it, since it is a legal contract that you are actually signing by installing the fonts.
